About us: 

The Genomic Alliance is a consortium of medical professionals focussing on the exploration and development of Genetic Testing as it pertains to personalized care and best practices.  Genetic Testing is still new and not well understood on a macro level.  There are currently no clearly defined industry standards or best practices in which to implement or deliver testing of this magnitude.  

The Genomic Alliance has taken the experience and perspective of thousands of medical professionals from all over the country in order to begin writing this book - the more authors we have, the great the outcome we can collectively achieve.  

We welcome any medical profession: doctors, nurses, scientist, engineers, business professionals and technology providers; that have feedback, experience or a perspective to share on genetic testing, to join our cohort and help define the next generation of medical testing protocols and disease care management.

Become the face of Pro-Active Healthcare and come together with our world class healthcare leaders to provide a perspective on technology that is changing lives everyday.
